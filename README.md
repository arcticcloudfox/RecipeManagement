This is my take at creating a program that can manage recipes. This will be my long term project where I add anything I can think of to help user engagement, have a smooth interface, and make it 
easy to use.

The user will be able to add, edit, delete, comment on other users' recipes, etc.

If you see changes in usernames in terms of code it is still me, another person just uses the same computer and software so the usernames may change.
